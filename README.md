This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a React project made for a kid's game.
I was tasked with building a website to display information about Animal Action Cards game for kids.
I'm translating UX design to code, and I also have freedom to come up with interactive games to play with the cards.
Currently I'm in the process of building a memory game component. Work in process.
